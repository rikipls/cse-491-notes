# CSE 491 Lecture Notes

My notes taken on the lecture videos at https://msu-cse491.github.io/CSE491/schedule.html

#### Note
This repo is meant to be read as an Obsidian vault since the markdown files are being written in that software. The code examples work fine, but if you want to view the images correctly then you must use Obsidian.

##### Another note
Of course, I only take notes on what's relevant/important for me to retain; not all in-video code examples are in the notes so if something seems missing then check out the videos themselves.
